# GitHub Actions Scripts

‚û°Ô∏è This is a fork of [YAML with Script](https://gitlab.com/matthiesen-technology/yaml-with-script)
adapted to work for GitHub Actions instead of GitLab CI/CD

üöÄ **Extend YAML files with embedded shell scripts and linting** ‚Äì the perfect
solution for seamless automation and debugging directly within VS Code!

### üí° Primary Use Case: **GitHub Actions**

This extension is specifically designed for **GitHub Actions**, making it easier
to work with workflow files. Automate, debug, and test your CI pipelines
without the need for constant commits and pushes.

---

## Features

- **CodeLens Integration**: Add interactive buttons to YAML files to execute
  shell scripts (`run`) with a single click.
- **ShellCheck Support**: Integrated linting to detect and fix issues in your
  shell scripts.
- **Real-time YAML Analysis**: Provides instant feedback on YAML file syntax
  errors and warnings directly in the VS Code Problems panel.
- **Optimized for GitHub Actions**: Simplifies working with GitHub workflows,
  including `run` blocks and composite actions.
- **Customizable Settings**: Configure script dialects, severity levels, and
  other options via the extension settings.

## Example Usage

### GitHub Actions workflow file with a script

`run` blocks are getting highlighted, checked
with [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) and are executable
with a button click on `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Script`.

### How to execute a script:

1. Open a github workflow file in VS Code.
2. Click the **CodeLens button** (`‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Script`) above your script.
3. The script is executed in a new terminal.

### Automated Debugging with ShellCheck

When errors are detected in your shell script, they are highlighted directly in
VS Code:

- **Severity Levels**:
  - Errors
  - Warnings
  - Info
  - Style

Quickly check issues with direct links to the
[ShellCheck documentation](https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki). _Unfortunately
quick actions are not implemented, but might be in the future._
